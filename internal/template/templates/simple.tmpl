Generate a short, imperative mood commit message summarizing the following code changes (git diff):

```diff
{{.Diff}}
```

Rules:
1. Be concise (ideally < 72 chars).
2. Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
3. Do not include the diff itself in the final message.
4. Output only the raw commit message text.
5. Do not use quotation marks around the message.
